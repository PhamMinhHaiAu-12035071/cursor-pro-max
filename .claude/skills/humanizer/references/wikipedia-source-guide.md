# Wikipedia Source Guide

## Attribution

This skill is based on [Wikipedia:Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup.

## Key insight

> "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."

This explains why AI writing feels generic: the model optimizes for the average case, producing text that is technically correct but lacks the specificity and personality that distinguish human writing.

## Pattern origins

The patterns documented in this skill come from observations of thousands of instances of AI-generated text on Wikipedia. Wikipedia editors identified these patterns through manual review of articles suspected of being AI-generated, making this one of the most empirically grounded guides available.

## Staying current

AI writing patterns evolve as models improve. The Wikipedia page is actively maintained and updated. When reviewing text, consider that:

- Newer models may produce fewer obvious markers
- Some patterns (like em dash overuse) may diminish over time
- New patterns may emerge as models change
- The fundamental issue (statistical averaging) remains constant regardless of model improvements
